VSCP is a framework for IoT/m2m hardware that can communicate over many different mediums and protocols. This library can be used to communicate with a VSCP remote host in an easy and intuitive way. The library supports all Arduino Ethernet Client compatible hardware.

**VscpTcpClient** is open and free to use with no restrictions, as is the above software, which is released under MIT license.

Current information about VSCP (Very Simple Control Protocol) can be found at https://www.vscp.org.

The library is licensed under [the  MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) so it can be used freely in opne and closed project.

Viewable/downloadable documentation for VSCP & Friends is [here](https://docs.vscp.org)

VscpTcpClient is very much influenced by [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient) MQTT client for Arduino by [Nick O'Leary](https://github.com/knolleary). So if you have used this library you will probably feel at home also with the VscpTcpClient library.
